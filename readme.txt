== Description ==

[Spot.IM](https://www.spot.im/) is the next-generation user engagement platform that reimagines the way you think about your comment section. In only 5 minutes, you can turn your website's old comment section into something of real value by leveraging your users' conversations and social output.

Spot.IM incentivizes your users to create engaging User Generated Content through a beautiful, instantaneous chat UI.

Actionable, sticky notifications alert your users immediately to replies on their comments and other trending conversations across your site.

= Dynamic Newsfeed =

The Spot.IM Newsfeed enables websites to expose their content to their users in the most efficient way possible. The above-the-fold Newsfeed sorts and highlights the first 140 characters of each of your article's most fantastic user Reply, and displays that Reply in the context of the article. Being able to see what other users have to say is increasingly vital information for users when deciding whether your content is relevant and worth reading.

The Spot.IM Newsfeed automatically prioritizes both your professional and user-generated content uniquely for each of your site's visitors. It's about getting the right content to the right reader.

= Group and Private Messaging =

Your users see other online visitors and engage them in a free-flowing dialogue in either group or direct message.

= Mobile Integration =

Spot.IM on your site is automatically optimized for all mobile platforms, ensuring that your users get just as much out of your site when they're on the go as when they're at home.

= Prioritized Moderation =

Moderation can be time-consuming, and even expensive. Spot.IM provides you with an unprecedented degree of automation, ease, and control to take the hard work out of monitoring your site.

= Social Elements =

Spot.IM combines a host of features that keep your users engaged with your content and one another at all times.

= What is SEO and does Spot support it? =

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. When you’re asking if Spot.IM has SEO, you’re asking if Spot allows all of your User Generated Content (UGC) to be indexed on your site so that a search engine like Google, or Bing, can read it.

The answer to that question is yes! Spot.IM is SEO-compatible. Unlike other popular commenting systems like Disqus or Facebook Comments, Spot.IM not only allows your UGC to be indexed and searched, it indexes that content only on your site itself. Other commenting systems use their own 3rd party destination websites to index your UGC, which means that when keywords are searched, their content comes up, and not yours.

With Spot.IM, your content is your content, no matter if its an article you wrote or a user conversation in the comment section. This gives your website improved visibility in every way.

= How do I get mobile working for my Spot? =

Spot.IM is automatically mobile web compatible. All you need to do is set it up for your WordPress website using the Plugin instructions above, and you’ll have a beautiful, responsive, slick mobile commenting and Newsfeed interface that works on all phones and tablets.

The language of the user’s browser determines the language of the interface: If a user is using a browser in French, they will see the translated interface in French, etc.

= Is spam filtered? =

Yes. To go along with other moderation tools, Spot.IM offers extensive word filter, blacklist, and spam control tools.

= How much does it cost? =

Spot.IM is free! We care deeply about returning the power of content to publishers, and we want our product’s pricing to reflect that.

= How do I update my Spot? =

Like with other WordPress plugins, updating your Spot is easy. When an update is available, you’ll receive a notification on your site’s WordPress dashboard. From that dashboard, you’ll be able to quickly and easily update Spot.

www.fightofthenight.com
